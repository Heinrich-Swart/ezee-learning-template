    question: "What is GED?",
    answer: `The GED is an American High School Equivalency Certificate. It is internationally recognized as a high school diploma equivalent or Grade 12 equivalent in South Africa. Many parents choose this after following a variety of home education approaches.

The South African Qualifications Authority (SAQA) evaluates each submission of a foreign qualification on a case-by-case basis. SAQA has evaluated the GED and found the South African National Senior Certificate (NSC) as its closest comparable qualification.`,
